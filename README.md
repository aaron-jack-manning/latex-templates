# LaTex Templates

These are some LaTeX templates that I have created for different projects to my liking, and therefore reuse them often. Any other templates I create I will put here in case they are useful to anyone else.

If you plan on using these templates at the command line I would highly recommend using [tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/) as it is in my experience by far the best front end to TeX in terms of user experience.
